# ID Card Generator using Tkinter

This project is an ID card generator built using Python's Tkinter library. The application provides a user-friendly interface for creating custom ID cards, where users can input their details and upload a photo. The generated ID card can then be saved as an image file for printing or digital use.

## Features:
- **Simple GUI:** A straightforward Tkinter-based interface for easy input of ID card details like name, roll number, major, and gender.
- **Image Upload:** Allows users to upload a custom image to be included in the ID card.
- **Custom Template:** The ID card design is generated using the ReportLab library, ensuring a professional and clean layout.
- **Multi-File Structure:** The project is divided into three Python files to manage different functionalities:
  1. `tk_id_input.py`: The main file that runs the Tkinter interface for input.
  2. `tk_id_card_temp.py`: Handles the ID card template design.
  3. `tk_id_card_main.py`: Generates the final ID card using the inputs and template.
  
## How to Run:
1. Ensure all three Python files (`tk_id_input.py`, `tk_id_card_temp.py`, and `tk_id_card_main.py`) are in the same directory.
2. Run the project in VS Code or any other IDE that supports Python.
3. Execute the `tk_id_input.py` file to start the application.

This project is perfect for those looking to create personalized ID cards for small events, projects, or organizations without the need for complex design tools.
